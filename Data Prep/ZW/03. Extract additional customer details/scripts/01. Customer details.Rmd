# OBJECTIVE

When hovering on a customer in the app, it should display whether a customer is intermediated (and agent code) and product details (number and name of products).

Extract the following details:
* Agent code tied to a customer
* Number of products held by a customer across the subsidiary and their names
* Business lines that owns the customer across the subsidiary
* Merge products held and agent code into a single column

# AGENT DETAILS

## Asset Mgt

`ACCOUNT_NUMBER` is the unique customer identifier.

```{r}

  file = "../../../../../../C - Documentation/Data/festus_extraction/ZW/customer_investment.csv", 
  sep = ";", 
  na.strings = c(""," ")) %>% 
  filter(ACCOUNT_NUMBER > 10000) %>% 
  select(UNIQUE_ID = ACCOUNT_NUMBER, AGENT_CODE) %>% 
  mutate(UNIQUE_ID = as.character(UNIQUE_ID)) %>% 
  mutate(intermediated = if_else(condition = is.na(AGENT_CODE), 
                                 true = "No", 
                                 false = "Yes"))

## General Insurance

`CUSTOMER_NO` is the unique customer identifier.

```{r}
